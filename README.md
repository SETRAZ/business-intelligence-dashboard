# DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF A B.I. DASHBOARD CREATION ASSISTANT
## Abstract
Business Intelligence (BI) is the process of using software or systems to transform business data into insights that can improve decision-making. This project aims to address challenges in creating effective BI dashboards through the development of an intelligent assistant that provides customized and context-aware guidance to dashboard designers.
## Project Overview
Creating effective dashboards is challenging, as it requires finding the optimal balance between functionality, aesthetics and usability. This project proposes a novel approach to dashboard design by developing a prototype BI dashboard creation assistant that leverages machine learning techniques to automate visualization selection and layout optimization.
## Challenges Addressed
- Choosing the right metrics and KPIs that align with dashboard objectives and user needs
- Organizing and presenting data in a clear and consistent way that highlights key insights
- Optimizing the performance and usability of dashboards
- Ensuring dashboards are interactive and user-friendly
## Architecture
The prototype follows a four-stage pipeline:
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Convert datasets into tabular data format (CSV/JSON)
- Add metadata annotations for each data attribute using tools like Data Voyager
- Handle dimensional models (Star Schemas) by flattening into single/multiple tables
- Ensure data quality and consistency
### 2. VizML Integration
VizML automatically generates visualizations based on machine learning models trained on large corpus of datasets. Key components include:
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms datasets into standardized format
- **Feature extraction**: Extracts statistical, semantic, and structural features
- **Model training**: Uses neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting
- **Visualization recommendation**: Generates ranked list of recommended visualizations in Vega-Lite grammar
### 3. Tile Networks for Layout Optimization
Tile Networks use reinforcement learning to optimize 2D geometric configurations:
- Employs encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention mechanisms
- Learns optimal arrangement of visualizations on dashboard pages
- Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for policy learning
- Considers factors: readability, aesthetics, balance, coherence
### 4. Power BI Integration
- Translates optimized layouts from Tile Networks into Microsoft Power BI format
- Generates publishable dashboard reports
- Supports scheduled data refresh and deployment
## Design Guidelines
The system follows established visualization guidelines:
### Visualization Selection by Data Type:
- **Numerical Data**: Bar graphs, line charts, violin plots, scatter plots, box plots
- **Categorical Data**: Pie charts, dot plots
- **Temporal Data**: Area charts, heatmaps, timelines
- **Spatial Data**: Maps, dot maps, bubble charts
### Layout Optimization Principles:
- Define objective and scope of report
- Use reinforcement learning for optimal arrangement based on user feedback
- Employ containers to group related visualizations
- Use grids for alignment and distribution
- Utilize white spaces for visual hierarchy
## Evaluation Strategies
The effectiveness of BI dashboards can be evaluated using:
### Primary Metrics:
- **Usage Rate**: Regular utilization by stakeholders
- **Usability**: System Usability Scale (SUS), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
- **Value**: Business benefits enabled by data-driven decision-making
### Additional Factors:
- Ease of use and user interface design
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Speed and scalability
- Data integration capabilities
- Drill-down and filtering capabilities
- Alignment with business goals
- Cost-benefit analysis
## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning**: VizML for visualization recommendation
- **Deep Learning**: Tile Networks with reinforcement learning
- **Data Processing**: Power Query Editor, Data Voyager
- **Visualization Grammar**: Vega-Lite
- **Platform**: Microsoft Power BI
- **Implementation**: TensorFlow Tile-Coding package
## Research Questions
1. **RQ1**: What are the requirements and specifications for developing a BI dashboard design assistant?
2. **RQ2**: How can various machine learning techniques be integrated to develop a BI dashboard design assistant?
## Future Work
- Complete automation and integration of the proposed architecture
- Enhanced evaluation strategies with automatic quality assessment
- User-friendly graphical interface for BI analysts
- Robust security features and access controls
- Real-time synchronization with Power BI
- Cost-benefit analysis modules
